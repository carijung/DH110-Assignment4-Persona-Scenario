### Taehyun's Scenario
#### Taehyun's purpose of using unep.org
Taehyun's professor just assigned him a data-based project to complete in four days. Due to the limited time, instead of scouring through the web and gathering too many resources, he would like to have few reliable resources. Highly interested in ameliorating greenhouse gas emissions and congestion in South Korea, he    wants to find statistics that will support the issues he chose. Taehyun wants to be able to filter the data himself to compare emission and congestion rates with different countries.

Taehyun reiterates this process but instead clicks "Air"     because his project will involve air quality. Once again failing to find information on South Korea, Taehyun thinks 'why are there no statistics present?' Impatiently moving his mouse cursor around, he clicks on the search button and types "data on sustainability in South Korea," but is faced with irrelevant articles. 

😆Luckily, the "Publication & data" option has a drop down menu that separates publication and data. Additionally, it offers a menu called "Data by sustainable goals and countries" where he successfully downloads data by filtering by country and sustainable goals.
