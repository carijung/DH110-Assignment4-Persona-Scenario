### Taehyun's Scenario
#### Taehyun's purpose of using unep.org
Taehyun's professor just assigned him a data-based project to complete in four days. Due to the limited time, instead of scouring through the web and gathering too many resources, he would like to have few reliable resources. Highly interested in ameliorating greenhouse gas emissions and congestion in South Korea, he wants to find statistics that will support the issues he chose. Taehyun wants to be able to filter the data himself to compare emission and congestion rates with different countries. 

#### Taehyun's usage of unep.org
Rushing back to his dorm, he opens his laptop and lands on the unep.org homepage. Immediatly, he is able to see the "publication & data" menu on the navigation bar which has three submenus: publication, data, and data on sustainability goals by country. Taehyun clicks on "sustainability goals by country" and immediately finds filtering options for sustainability goals and countries/regions and proceeeds to download the data for greenhouse gas emissions due to agriculture and urban populations complied on Microsoft Excel. Taehyun then easily switches the countries to compare data. He believes he will be able to finish his project in no time. 

😡 However he is faced with a laundry list of articles rather than statistics specific to his country. Taehyun reiterates this process but instead clicks "Air" because his project will involve air quality. Once again failing to find information on South Korea, Taehyun thinks 'why are there no statistics present?' Impatiently moving his mouse cursor around, he clicks on the search button and types "data on sustainability in South Korea," but is faced with irrelevant articles. 

😆Luckily, the "Publication & data" option has a drop down menu that separates publication and data. Additionally, it offers a menu called "Data by sustainable goals and countries" where he successfully downloads data by filtering by country and sustainable goals.

### Olivia's Scenario
#### Olivia's purpose of using unep.org
Twenty five years as working as a recreation manager and witnessing issues that arised in urban areas, Olivia wants to provide opportunities for people in her community to actively participate in advancing our progress towards reaching a sustainable community. Wanting to brainstorm ideas for potential activities and create fliers that include alarming statistics, events/activities, previous damages, she finds unep.org and thinks that this site seems to house many resources. 

#### Olivia's usage of unep.org
Olivia sees the "What you can do" menu on the navigation tab and sees the different actions like "take climate action," "take nature action," "take chemicals and pollution action," "learn to restore ecosystems," and "campaign for better air quality."
