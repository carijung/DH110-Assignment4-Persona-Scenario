## 📜 Purpose of UX Storytelling 

The purpose of UX storytelling is to gain complete insight and perspective on what users want instead of making assumptions on what they would prefer. Storytelling helps us determine the types of users involved in the utilization of our digital product focusing on our environment. As a platform that is accessible by all users with access to the internet, understanding each user is key to developing the unep.org website.

## 🗺️Scenarios and Journey Map

> My purpose is to enhance features that seem to be hidden away

### 1. Taehyun's Scenario
#### Taehyun's purpose of using unep.org
Taehyun's professor just assigned him a data-based project to complete in four days. Due to the limited time, instead of scouring through the web and gathering too many resources, he would like to have few reliable resources. Highly interested in ameliorating greenhouse gas emissions and congestion in South Korea, he wants to find statistics that will support the issues he chose. Taehyun wants to be able to filter the data himself to compare emission and congestion rates with different countries. 

#### Taehyun's usage of unep.org
Rushing back to his dorm, he opens his laptop and lands on the unep.org homepage. Immediatly, he is able to see the "publication & data" menu on the navigation bar which has three submenus: publication, data, and data on sustainability goals by country. Taehyun clicks on "data on sustainability goals by country" and lands on an interactive page where he can filter his search results by sustainability goals and countries/regions. He proceeeds to click "cities and communities," selects "greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture," and selects "Republic of Korea." Taehyun successfully downloads the data compiled on Microsoft Excel. Wanting to find more data on different topics like urban population and compare data with different countries, he reloads the page. All his previous selections are gone, which allows Taehyun to make new selections without having to deselect all his past ones. However, the data that he previously requested remains at the bottom of the page along with a description which explicitly states his selections: "cities and communities / greenhouse gas emmisions by agriculture / Republic of Korea." Taehyun believes this efficient process will allow him to finish his project in no time.

### 2. Olivia's Scenario
#### Olivia's purpose of using unep.org
Twenty five years as working as a recreation manager and witnessing issues that arised in urban areas, Olivia wants to provide opportunities for people in her community to actively participate in advancing our progress towards reaching a sustainable community. Wanting to brainstorm ideas for potential activities and create fliers that include alarming statistics, events/activities, previous damages, she finds unep.org and thinks that this site seems to house many resources. 

#### Olivia's usage of unep.org
Olivia sees the "What you can do" menu on the navigation tab and sees the different actions like "take climate action," "take nature action," "take chemicals and pollution action," "learn to restore ecosystems" (external link) and "campaign for better air quality" (external link). Visiting each page and reading about how one can get involved, she brainstorms few ideas like installing a walking tracker app and offering prizes for those who show great increase in the number of steps. She also comes up with ideas about partnering with already existing organizations that serve the underserved community and planning activities in parks. 

Curious about achieving a sustainable community, she navigates to the "what we do" tab and clicks on "sustainable cities and communities." Landing on the page, Olivia is able to see all the goals aesthetically listed. The indicator that is a shape of a pointing finger indicates that the goals are clickable, which helps Olivia click on "Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities" and find interactive visualizations and links that lead her to finding information about 279 million people experiencing lack of electricity and more. With the informations, she is able to create a physical flier that she will pass out to those with no access to internet while her daughters will post the digital flier on social media to spread awareness and plans to restore the community.

### 3. Daphney's Scenario
#### Daphney's purpose of using unep.org
As an architect, Daphney wants to mitigate housing insecurity in Kenya. Before getting involved, she wants to learn more about what issues Kenya is experiencing and how they have been responding. Her coworker who has served in Kenya three years ago suggests unep.org. Daphney thinks that this site houses many information and thinks she would be able to gain many insights. 

#### Daphney's usage of unep.org
Daphney immediately locates "where we work" and sees that UNEP is working in Africa. Clicking on Africa she is led to a page which displays challenges Africa is facing and few articles. She is thankful that the page does not immediately show a laundry list of articles she would've had to scroll through. Instead she finds a "see more articles and resources" that allows her to view more resources by choice. Daphney clicks on it and explores up to five pages of the list of articles. Currently in page 5/32, she wants to go back to the previous page without having to scroll all the way down and clicking "previous page." Luckily, the back button present on top of the window serves the same purpose. There is also a "back to Africa homepage" that allows her to go back to the frontpage without having to reiterate the process of looking for "Africa" in the navigation tab or continuously click on the back button. Enraptured by the rich resources this site provides, she visits different tabs but there is the search bar visible and fixed on the navigation bar that she can use to search for articles on Kenya or Africa, regardless of which page she is currently viewing.
